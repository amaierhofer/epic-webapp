  EPIC makes your mobile phone remotely accessible and turns it into a remote control. EPIC is free, open, extensible, and ready to use. Give it a try and drop us a line if you like it or not! Get started by checkout out the demos below or #{link_to 'login', :new_session} back to your account if you already #{link_to 'signed up', :new_user}.

  ## What?
  Epic focuses on mobile devices (such as Android and webOS smartphones) and connects them with each other and with web-applications running in standard browsers.It is a easy protocol that shall grow to an open standard that drives the internet-of-things. We believe that the internet-of-things will be developed by individuals (rather than big companies) and want to enable people to participate. Because we want to help you to build the internet-of-things application you always dreamed of EVERYTHING ON THIS PAGE IS FREE, OPEN SOURCE, AND LICENCED UNDER CREATIVE COMMONS.
  
  ## Why?
  People use an ever increasing number of devices to connect to the internet (desktop, phone, tv).Rarely are those devices aware of each others existence or activities.We believe many benefits could be gained from making these devices talk to each other. On our web-page we collect information about the required technologies, showcase potential applications, and want to feature tutorials about how to set up such systems.

  ## How?
  We use a bunch of technologies to connect mobile devices to each other as well as to web-pages. The Epic architecture enables close-to-realtime peer-to-peer communication. The Android application starts a background service on the mobile phone.Other applications can connect to this service and use it to send messages to other peers. The service itself listens for messages and distributes them to the appropriate applications on the mobile device. A more in depth description of the #{link_to 'Epic Service for Android', :about} gives an overview of the general architecture. #{link_to 'XMPP is the core technology', :about_technology} that enables peer-to-peer in the Epic architecture.
